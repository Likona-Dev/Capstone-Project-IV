# Capstone-Project-IV

## Poised Project Manager

## Project Details

### Description

This program was created  for the Hyperion Development Software Engineering Bootcamp level 2 Capstone Project
This is a project management system software developed in Java. 
Created for a small structural engineering firm called “Poised”. 
Poised does the engineering needed to ensure the structural integrity 
of various buildings. 
The program keeps track of the many projects on which they work.

### Functionality

The 'PoiseManager uml diagram.pdf' file in the repository with the Poised project java files shows the details of all the classes that will
be used in a later stage of this program.

Poised stores the following information for each project that they work on:
● Project number.
● Project name.
● What type of building is being designed? E.g. House, apartment block or
store, etc.
● The physical address for the project.
● ERF number.
● The total fee being charged for the project.
● The total amount paid to date.
● Deadline for the project.
● The name, telephone number, email address and physical address of the
architect for the project.
● The name, telephone number, email address and physical address of the
contractor for the project.
● The name, telephone number, email address and physical address of the
customer for the project.

**When a project is finalised**
An invoice will be generated for the client. This invoice contains the customer’s details and the total amount that the customer must still pay. This amount is calculated by subtracting the total amount paid to date from the total fee for the project. If the customer has already paid the full fee, an invoice is not generated.
